      <h2>Welcome to Midnight Movies Minneapolis!</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Dale. I love movies. I love seeing movies in theaters, and I <em>especially</em> love seeing movies in independent theaters right here in the Twin Cities. I made Midnight Movies Minneapolis so I could share that love. The Twin Cities pride themselves on their artistic culture - from the Walker Art Center to the Orpheum, from Art-a-Whirl to the Fringe Festival, the Twin Cities has a vibrant community of artists and art-lovers.</p>
       <p>But all too often the medium of film gets the short stick. I've been to too many movies where my friends and I were the only ones in attendence. The experience of seeing a film in a theater can never be replicated in your home. Even with a top-of-the-line entertainment system, nothing can replace the sense of ritual or community that making an event out of a screening can provide.</p>
       <p>Midnight Movies Minneapolis is here to make it as easy as possible for you to see a classic movie in one of our fair cities' independent theaters. Right now it's just an index of showtimes, but as it grows I hope it becomes a community unto itself.</p>
